      <h1>Working with Wireframes</h1>

      <p>
        Last week you got a look at a
        <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/rafting_images/wireframe_home.png" target="_blank">wireframe</a>
        while building out your site plan. Wireframes are valuable tools in
        web design. They help visualize what should be on a page and where
        each piece of content should be in relation to each other. We need to
        stop however and learn a little bit about how to read a wireframe and
        how to take a wireframe and convert it into HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will <strong>not</strong> be learning to make wireframes at this
        point. Only using them.
      </p>
      <ol class="bigSteps">
        <li>
          <h3>Reading wireframes</h3>
          <p>
            First visit
            <a href="https://fuzzymath.com/blog/how-to-read-a-wireframe/" target="_blank">How to read a wireframe</a>
            and spend some time looking at the infographic to familiarize
            yourself with what you can expect to find on a wireframe.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>From Wireframe to Website</h3>
          <p>
            Follow along with this video and wireframe example, to practice with coding HTML with this wireframe:
          </p>
          <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/978949-Responsive-Wireframe-Templates-GIF/attachments/113429" target="_blank">wireframe example</a>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="./Working with Wireframes_files/0kSzoBvYpXU.html" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Not sure which element to use. W3schools.com is a great resource. Here is a page describing different
            elements you might use for different content:</p>
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp" target="_blank">HTML5 Semantic
            Elements</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Need some placeholder images in HTML if you don't have your images picked out yet?</p>
          <a href="https://placeimg.com/" target="_blank">PlaceIMG</a>:
          is a placeholder image generator. If we need something to use as images
          for our page. This is a quick and easy way to get some. Usage:
          <pre class=" language-markup"><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>img</span> <span class="token attr-name">src</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>https://placeimg.com/320/240/animals<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">/&gt;</span></span></code> </pre>
          This would give you a random image that was 320px X 240px large.
        </li>
        
        
        <li>
          <h3>Important!</h3>
          <p>
            Remember that our goal is not to produce a finished version of the
            example site. It will look very rough. We are only trying to make sure we get
            all of the markup to include all of the content represented in the
            wireframe. Your finished page <strong>WILL NOT</strong> look like
            the wireframe.
          </p>
          <p>
            NO CSS is required for this weeks assignment. You should only be
            writing HTML.
          </p>

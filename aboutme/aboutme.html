    <h2>Amy</h2>
    <p>Hello!  My name is Amy Burton.  I am from southern California but currently live in Houston, Texas.
        I am back in school full time and not working.  I am on track to achieve my bachelors in Applied Technology
        this December.  I am looking forward to learning more about programming in this class.  I was blessed 
        over the last two years to be able to help care for my ailing father and spend that time with him 
        before he passed.  I look forward to getting to know you all this semester.</p>

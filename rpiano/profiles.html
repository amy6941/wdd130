                        Suzie has been involved with music her whole life. Her dad played piano and the ukelele, so there was always music in the house. At five, Suzie started piano lessons and then taught herself to play the guitar. She played in bands and orchestras throughout high school and college. Suzie now enjoys teaching a new generation her love of music.

                        Guitar, piano, and ukulele teacher, Amy Burton, has been studying and playing music for over 23 years. After playing in several bands and music projects, she decided that passing on her love for music to the next generation was the next path for her life. It’s easy to recognize her varied influences in her versatility with different genres of music. Amy believes that music is fundamental to the soul of human nature and to know music is to better understand ourselves. “Playing and listening to music can improve mood, reduce anxiety, ease pain and have positive effects on our neurobiology and cognitive functioning.”

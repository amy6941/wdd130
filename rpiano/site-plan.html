      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Wouldn’t you love to have one central location to get all your information, pay for lessons and materials and sign up for classes?  This would be a place for me to communicate with all my students and parents.  It would be a resource for them to see happenings and check information and schedules.  The app would also ideally allow for them to print out statements and sign up for lessons.  It would have a calendar to show my availability as well.  The site would be a one stop shop for all my current and future piano students.

        [KEYBOARD & PIANO LESSONS FOR BEGINNERS
        Ramsey Piano’s keyboard and piano lessons are vastly different from traditional one-on-one beginner piano lessons that most students end up dreading. At Ramsey Piano, our teachers get students to love the Piano (and keyboard) by teaching them to play popular rock songs while implementing basic concepts and skills like finger placement, scales, pedaling, key differentiation and rhythm. We start with private lessons paired with band rehearsals to prepare our piano students to play a live gig with a full band.
        
        INTERMEDIATE TO ADVANCED KEYBOARD LESSONS
        As our students begin progressing through the beginner keyboard and piano lessons, we identify their progress and, when it's time, move them up to amplified and more challenging intermediate to advanced keyboard techniques. This is where students will develop their skills even further and immerse themselves deeper into learning the ins-and-outs of the piano and keyboard through private lessons, group rehearsals and live performances on stage.
        
        TAKE KEYBOARD AND PIANO LESSONS ONLINE AND IN-SCHOOL
        At Ramsey Piano, the health and safety of our students is our top priority. We’re offering online music lessons in addition to in-person socially distanced classes. Students choosing to take keyboard and piano lessons online are taught using the same famous, patented curriculum we use in our school. This approach couples in-person or online keyboard and piano lessons with our song first approach and method books.
        
        Piano for All Ages – 
        Our music program for kids in the Katy area is designed to get students on stage performing, with the goal of building strong musical proficiency. Younger students at Ramsey Piano who have participated in the Rookies program can move to our Music 101 music program once they’re ready. Additionally, students (typically ages 8 to 13-years-old) can begin Music 101 without any prior experience.
        
        Ramsey Piano's Adult Program is for students over 18 years old who are looking to either improve their musical proficiency or pick up piano with no prior musical experience.  The Adult Program uses a performance-based music education approach. This means the curriculum focuses on learning music concepts and applying them in a live performance setting. Every student at Ramsey Piano is assigned specific songs as a way of learning key music concepts and skills. 
        
        Preschoolers and Kids:
        At Ramsey Piano we've figured out how to ensure kids have fun while they’re learning how to play the piano proficiently. This is what makes our piano and keyboard lessons for beginners the most popular piano program in the world for children. 
        
        
        
        Teens: 
        Teens who enroll in our piano and keyboard lessons gain skill and confidence on the piano while also developing the tools they need to work in a team. Every program for teens includes private piano lessons and group rehearsals that will prepare the student for live performances.
        
        Adults: 
        It's never too late to learn to play the piano! Our expert piano teachers guide you through the fundamentals of the piano through private keyboard lessons, group rehearsals, and live performances, all done by way of playing popular rock songs. Learn more about our Adult Program for musicians 18 and up.

        <img src="images/suzier.jpg" alt="Suzie Ramsey">
        <p>Suzie has been involved with music her whole life. Her dad played piano and the ukelele, so there was always music in the house. At five, Suzie started piano lessons and then taught herself to play the guitar. She played in bands and orchestras throughout high school and college. Suzie now enjoys teaching a new generation her love of music.</p>

        <p>
          Guitar, piano, and ukulele teacher, Amy Burton, has been studying and playing music for over 23 years. After playing in several bands and music projects, she decided that passing on her love for music to the next generation was the next path for her life. It’s easy to recognize her varied influences in her versatility with different genres of music. Amy believes that music is fundamental to the soul of human nature and to know music is to better understand ourselves. “Playing and listening to music can improve mood, reduce anxiety, ease pain and have positive effects on our neurobiology and cognitive functioning.”

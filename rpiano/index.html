                    KEYBOARD & PIANO LESSONS FOR BEGINNERS 
                    Ramsey Piano’s keyboard and piano lessons are vastly different from traditional one-on-one beginner piano lessons that most students end up dreading. At Ramsey Piano, our teachers get students to love the Piano (and keyboard) by teaching them to play popular rock songs while implementing basic concepts and skills like finger placement, scales, pedaling, key differentiation and rhythm. We start with private lessons paired with band rehearsals to prepare our piano students to play a live gig with a full band.

                    INTERMEDIATE TO ADVANCED KEYBOARD LESSONS 
                    As our students begin progressing through the beginner keyboard and piano lessons, we identify their progress and, when it's time, move them up to amplified and more challenging intermediate to advanced keyboard techniques. This is where students will develop their skills even further and immerse themselves deeper into learning the ins-and-outs of the piano and keyboard through private lessons, group rehearsals and live performances on stage.

                    TAKE KEYBOARD AND PIANO LESSONS ONLINE AND IN-SCHOOL 
                    At Ramsey Piano, the health and safety of our students is our top priority. We’re offering online music lessons in addition to in-person socially distanced classes. Students choosing to take keyboard and piano lessons online are taught using the same famous, patented curriculum we use in our school. This approach couples in-person or online keyboard and piano lessons with our song first approach and method books. 
                    Piano for All Ages – Our music program for kids in the Katy area is designed to get students on stage performing, with the goal of building strong musical proficiency. Younger students at Ramsey Piano who have participated in the Rookies program can move to our Music 101 music program once they’re ready. Additionally, students (typically ages 8 to 13-years-old) can begin Music 101 without any prior experience. 
                    Ramsey Piano's Adult Program is for students over 18 years old who are looking to either improve their musical proficiency or pick up piano with no prior musical experience. The Adult Program uses a performance-based music education approach. This means the curriculum focuses on learning music concepts and applying them in a live performance setting. Every student at Ramsey Piano is assigned specific songs as a way of learning key music concepts and skills.
